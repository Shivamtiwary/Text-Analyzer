Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework designed for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It encourages the use of reusable code and follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle. Django simplifies web development by providing tools for handling common tasks such as URL routing, database interaction (via its powerful ORM), form handling, and user authentication. It includes a built-in admin interface, which allows for easy content management. With a focus on security, scalability, and flexibility, Django is suitable for building both small-scale projects and large, complex web applications, enabling developers to create robust solutions quickly.
